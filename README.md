A simple Node.js chat server with a 90s social chatroom feel.

Users can change their names and color.

The chat server works through Websockets, and its core library is Socket.io.
The server also includes the Connect module to simplify the serving of websites, for future expansions.

TODO:

Big Daddy: Admin / Ban / Kick commands.
Little Sister: Partner Node.js to provide chatbot functions, specifically Roll the Die.
Big Brother: Partner Node.js bot that can store chatlogs into a database.
Playful Jack: Database for chat-based games such as ++.
